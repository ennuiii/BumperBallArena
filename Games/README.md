**Players:** 2-6
**Complexity:** Low-Medium

A Simon Says-style memory game where players watch sequences of colors light up, then recreate them from memory to score points.

**Key Features:**
- Watch and replay phases

- Audio tones for each color (Web Audio API)
- Color-blind mode with symbols
- Multiple game modes (classic, speed run, survival, battle)
- Real-time player progress tracking

**Tech Highlights:**
- Web Audio API for sound synthesis
- Synchronized sequence display
- Real-time input validation
- Elimination and streak mechanics

## 📂 File Structure

Each game folder contains:

```
game-name/
├── README.md              # Complete game documentation
├── client-types.ts        # TypeScript types for client
├── server-types.ts        # TypeScript types for server
├── GameComponent.tsx      # React component (UI and client logic)
└── server-logic.ts        # Socket.IO event handlers and game logic
```

## 🚀 How to Use These Games

### Option 1: Copy Files Directly

1. **Choose a game** you want to implement
2. **Copy types** from `client-types.ts` → your `client/src/types.ts`
3. **Copy types** from `server-types.ts` → your `server/types.ts`
4. **Replace** `client/src/components/GameComponent.tsx` with the game's version
5. **Add handlers** from `server-logic.ts` to your `server/server.ts`
6. **Update Settings** interface in both client and server types
7. **Test** the game!

### Option 2: Reference Implementation

Use these as **reference implementations** to:
- Understand how to structure game logic
- See patterns for client-server communication
- Learn best practices for state management
- Get ideas for your own game mechanics

### Option 3: Modify and Customize

Take any game and **customize it**:
- Change rules and scoring
- Add new power-ups or mechanics
- Modify visual style
- Create hybrid games combining elements

## 🎯 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Client-Server Communication
All games show proper Socket.IO event patterns:
- Client emits user actions
- Server validates and processes
- Server broadcasts state updates
- Clients render based on state

### State Management
- **Server-authoritative:** Game state lives on server
- **Client prediction:** Immediate visual feedback
- **State synchronization:** Regular broadcasts
- **Optimistic updates:** Better UX

### Game Loops
- **Real-time (Space Invaders):** 60 tick/second server loop
- **Turn-based (Word Chain):** Event-driven state changes
- **Phase-based (Color Memory):** Synchronized phases

### Multiplayer Patterns
- **Competitive:** All games have scoring/ranking
- **Turn-taking:** Word Chain demonstrates rotation
- **Simultaneous play:** Color Memory shows sync challenges
- **Elimination:** Classic mode battle royale style

## 💡 Tips for Building Your Own Game

Based on these three examples:

1. **Start Simple:** Color Memory is the easiest - great starting point
2. **Plan Your State:** Define GameData interface first
3. **Server Authority:** Always validate on server, never trust client
4. **Phase Management:** Use clear game phases for state transitions
5. **Mobile First:** Design for touch controls from the start
6. **Test Early:** Use multiple browser windows to test multiplayer
7. **Error Handling:** Handle disconnects and edge cases
8. **Scoring System:** Make it fair and easy to understand
9. **Visual Feedback:** Players need immediate response to actions
10. **Fun First:** Focus on fun gameplay over complex features

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Game state not syncing
**Solution:** Ensure server broadcasts `game:state-update` regularly

### Issue: Lag in real-time games
**Solution:** Use client prediction + server reconciliation

### Issue: Players getting stuck in phases
**Solution:** Add timeouts for all phases, handle edge cases

### Issue: Scoring inconsistencies
**Solution:** Calculate all scores on server, broadcast results

### Issue: Mobile controls not working
**Solution:** Test with `onTouchStart` and `onClick` both
